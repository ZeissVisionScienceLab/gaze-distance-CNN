# CNN-based gaze distance estimation
Dataset and code for the publication "CNN-based estimation of gaze distance in virtual reality using eye tracking and depth data".  

## [VR Study](/Study)
A unity project to collect eye tracking data and ground truth distances while playing a reaction time game in VR.  

## [Replay Mode: Depth Extraction](/StudyDepthExtraction)
Replay mode of the experiment, where the scene depth data corresponding to the recorded eye tracking data is extracted after the experiment.  

## [Gaze Distance Prediction Methods](/GazeDistancePrediction)
CNN architecture, training pipeline, and a Jupyter Notebook that evaluates naive gaze distance estimation methods (vergence, and depth at the center of the gaze point).  

The dataset collected during the experiment which is then used to train our CNN can be accessed under [10.5281/zenodo.15439043](https://zenodo.org/records/15439043).  
Please see the corresponding publication for further details.
