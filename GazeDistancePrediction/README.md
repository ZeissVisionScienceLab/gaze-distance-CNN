For the CNN training pipeline to run, please download the training data from [10.5281/zenodo.15439043](https://zenodo.org/records/15439043). The CNN requires the file DistanceData.zip to be extracted and saved under /data/distancedata/indoor and /outdoor, respectively. Training the model additionally requires the file [et_data_cnn_rollingmedian.feather](/data/et_data_cnn_rollingmedian.feather), which contains the preprocessed eye tracking data.  
Run the file [main.py](/CNNET/main.py) to start training. The training parameters can also be adjusted within that file.  

The naive methods based on Vergence and the depth at the center of the gaze point are evaluated within a [Jupyter Notebook](</GazeDistancePrediction/Center and Vergence/center_estimation.ipynb>) and require the file [mlp_training_data_10percent_ang2.feather](/data/mlp_training_data_10percent_ang2.feather) which contains the preprocessed eye tracking data.  

For more details on the preprocessing, please see the corresponding publication.
